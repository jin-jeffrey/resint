# Resint - App for Tracking Job Applications

## Description:
#### Resint is a chrome extension with a web app that allows users to apply to jobs on LinkedIn and keep track of them. Users can log in/sign up, get a special authentication code that allows them to sign in to their chrome extension, and add the LinkedIn url of each job application that they submit. 

#### The app then scrapes the data from the LinkedIn page and saves it to a database. The user will have a dashboard page on Resint's web app that allows them to see and track their job applications.

## Tech stack:
#### Frontend: React
#### Backend: Node + Express, and Python (for web scrapping)
